## Project 1: Example UVM model

### Project Overview
This UVM verification project is a general verification model for any type of hardware projects, just make the necessary changes to the specification of the DUT to be tested.

## Project 2: UVM - 8-bit 8-input sorter 

### Project Overview
This project performs the verification of a module that organizes 8 8-bit inputs into outputs in an increasing manner, the verification plan is in the folder

## Project 3: UVM - FSM Sequence identifier 0001

### Project Overview
This project performs the FSM (finite state machine) verification used to detect a 4-bit sequence which is the sequence 0001, the verification plan is in the folder
